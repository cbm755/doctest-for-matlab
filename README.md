DOCTEST [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/catch22/octave-doctest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/catch22/octave-doctest)
=======

The Octave-Forge Doctest package finds specially-formatted blocks of example code within documentation files.
It then executes the code and confirms the output is correct.
This can be useful as part of a testing framework or simply to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date during software development.

See [doctest.m](inst/doctest.m) for more detailed inline documentation.
